    "## Word Embeddings: Learning Meaning from Context\n",

    "**Goal of this lab:** learn how *continuous vector representations* (embeddings) are learned from data, and how they are used in practical NLP workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you should be able to:\n",
    "1. Explain **distributional semantics** (\"meaning from context\").\n",
    "2. Train word embeddings using **Word2Vec** and **FastText** (with Gensim).\n",
    "3. Use embeddings for **similarity search** and **analogy / vector algebra**.\n",
    "4. Visualize a word embedding space and interpret what you see.\n",
    "5. Explain why embeddings help with **sparsity** and **generalization** compared to n-grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Industry relevance (why you should care)\n",
    "Even in the era of transformers, embeddings remain widely used for:\n",
    "- **Semantic search** and query expansion  \n",
    "- **Similarity / recommendation** (nearest neighbors in vector space)  \n",
    "- **Clustering** and exploratory analysis  \n",
    "- Lightweight NLP systems where large models are too expensive"

    "### Answer to Checkpoint 0\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Main limitation of one-hot vectors**: one-hot vectors represent each word as a sparse binary vector with a single 1 and all other positions as 0. the main limitation is that all words are treated as equally different from each other; there's no notion of semantic similarity. for example, \"king\" and \"queen\" are just as different as \"king\" and \"banana\" because their vectors are orthogonal, which doesn't capture the fact that some words are more related than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **\"meaning emerges from co-occurrence patterns\"**: this phrase means that words appearing in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings. if \"dog\" and \"cat\" both frequently appear near words like \"pet,\" \"animal,\" \"feed,\" and \"walk,\" we can infer they are semantically related even without explicit definitions. the distributional hypothesis suggests that linguistic items with similar distributions have similar meanings, essentially, you can understand what a word means by looking at the company it keeps."

    "\n",
    "1. **Why we remove stopwords**: we remove stopwords because they're high-frequency function words like \"the,\" \"and,\" \"is\" that appear in almost every context regardless of topic. since embeddings learn meaning from co-occurrence patterns, stopwords would dominate the context windows but provide little semantic value. removing them helps the model focus on content-bearing words that actually distinguish topics and meanings, making the learned vectors more informative about semantic relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **When removing stopwords could be bad**: removing stopwords would be problematic in sentiment analysis tasks where negation matters. phrases like \"not good\" vs \"good\" have opposite meanings, but if we remove \"not\" as a stopword, we lose critical information. similarly, in tasks like authorship attribution, stopwords and function words are actually very informative because they reveal writing style patterns that content words don't capture."

    "### Answer to Checkpoint 3\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Why analogy results might be wrong even with good embeddings**: analogy results can fail even with good embeddings because they depend on the specific training corpus and context patterns. as we saw with the king-queen example, the 20 newsgroups dataset contains \"king\" and \"queen\" primarily in non-royal contexts (rodney king), so the gender relationship isn't encoded in the vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why analogy evaluation might not correlate with task performance**: analogy tasks are intrinsic evaluations that test whether embeddings capture specific linguistic relationships in isolation, but downstream nlp tasks often require different properties. for example, a sentiment analysis model might perform well even if embeddings fail at gender analogies, because sentiment depends more on words' emotional valence than on analogical reasoning. conversely, embeddings that excel at analogies might still fail at a task if they don't capture the specific semantic distinctions that matter for that application."

    "\n",
    "1. **Closest words in the plot**: the health-related words form the tightest cluster, \"hospital\" and \"doctor\" are very close together at the top, with \"medicine\" and \"nurse\" nearby. on the right side, \"computer,\" \"hardware,\" and \"software\" form a tech cluster. \"government\" and \"policy\" are also relatively close to each other in the center-left area.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cluster visibility**: yes, there are visible semantic clusters, particularly the health cluster (hospital, doctor, medicine, nurse) in the upper portion and the tech cluster (computer, hardware, software) on the right. however, the clusters aren't perfectly separated, the politics words (government, policy, law, rights) are more scattered. \"internet\" is surprisingly far from the other tech words, and \"law\" is isolated on the left. this imperfect clustering happens because some words may co-occur across topics in the newsgroups dataset (e.g., discussions about internet policy or technology law could bridge categories), and with only ~11,000 training documents, there may not be enough data to fully separate all semantic domains."

    "1. **Would these neighbors help a search engine user?**: partially yes, but with significant gaps. neighbors like \"victoria,\" \"melbourne,\" \"airport,\" and \"northwest\" capture the travel/location context where hotels appear, which could help users find hotel-related content in those locations. however, more semantically relevant terms like \"motel,\" \"inn,\" \"accommodation,\" or \"lodging\" are missing (motel isn't even in the vocabulary). a user searching for \"hotel\" would likely want to see related lodging types, not just geographic locations that co-occur with the word. the neighbors reflect topical association rather than true semantic synonyms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What could go wrong in production?**: several critical issues: (1) **vocabulary coverage** - \"motel\" isn't in the vocabulary, so the system can't handle synonym expansion for common related terms, (2) **corpus bias** - results reflect the 20 newsgroups dataset (tech, politics, religion), not general-purpose search needs; a model trained on travel content would give very different neighbors, (3) **no query understanding** - the system treats \"hotel\" as a word in isolation without understanding user intent (booking a hotel vs. learning about hotel construction vs. hotel news), (4) **ranking issues** - similarity scores don't translate directly to search relevance; victoria (0.888) might not be more useful than a lower-scored but semantically closer term, and (5) **scalability** - this approach only works for single words, not phrases or complex queries like \"cheap hotels near airport.\""

    "### Answer to Final Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. How do embeddings solve the sparsity and \"no similarity\" issues of one-hot vectors?**\n",
    "\n",
    "embeddings solve sparsity by representing words as compact lists of numbers (typically 50-300 values) instead of huge vocabulary-sized vectors where almost everything is zero. this dramatically reduces the size and eliminates the wasteful representation where most values don't carry information. more importantly, embeddings solve the \"no similarity\" problem by learning representations where related words have similar number patterns; words like \"computer\" and \"software\" end up close together because they appear in similar contexts during training. in contrast, one-hot vectors treat all words as completely different from each other, so \"cat\" and \"dog\" have zero similarity, just like \"cat\" and \"carburetor.\" embeddings capture meaning through context patterns, following the principle that \"you shall know a word by the company it keeps.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What is a realistic industry task where word embeddings are useful?**\n",
    "\n",
    "a good example is improving search in e-commerce or content platforms. when a user searches for \"laptop\" on an online store, embeddings can help retrieve products labeled \"notebook computer\" or \"portable pc\" even though those exact words weren't in the search. the system measures how similar the search terms are to product descriptions, expanding results beyond exact matches. this is especially valuable for handling synonyms and related terms so if someone searches \"running shoes,\" the system can also show \"athletic footwear\" or \"jogging sneakers\" because these terms have similar embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. When would you choose FastText over Word2Vec?**\n",
    "\n",
    "i would choose fasttext over word2vec when dealing with user-generated content, languages with complex word forms, or specialized domains. fasttext's approach of breaking words into smaller pieces means it can handle words it's never seen before which is crucial for social media where users make typos, use slang, or create new hashtags. for example, with customer reviews, fasttext can generate reasonable representations for misspellings like \"amaazing\" or \"restaraunt\" by recognizing the shared letter patterns with \"amazing\" and \"restaurant.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. What is one risk or limitation of word embeddings that a practitioner should watch for?**\n",
    "\n",
    "a major limitation is that embeddings absorb and can amplify biases in the training data, which can lead to unfair outcomes when used in real systems. embeddings learn purely from word patterns so if the training text contains biased language or stereotypes, these get baked into the word vectors. for example, models trained on news articles have shown gender bias where \"doctor\" relates more to male words and \"nurse\" to female words, or racial bias in how different groups are associated with positive or negative terms. this becomes dangerous when embeddings are used in important applications like screening resumes, moderating content, or evaluating loan applications. developers need to carefully check their training data, test embeddings for known biases, and consider whether the training text really represents the diverse population who will use the system. just because embeddings show good similarity scores or pass analogy tests doesn't mean they're safe or fair to use in production."
